# Quantitative_UX
Jupyter notebooks with an introduction to Usability testing and analysis of quantitive data, including simple python (Pandas) exercises. 
Authored with some reference to Sauro and Lewis (2016)  "Quantifying the User Experience", Morgan Kaufmann publishing but expanding somewhat beyond the topic. Specifically, this interactive book aims to provide more insights into descriptive statistics and plotting, as well as probability and the assumptions for parametric tests.

The material is produced to be used for the BSc course UX: kvantitativ brugerevaluering for Medialogy students at Aalborg University, but I hope it will be useful
also as a general intro /recap for others. It is also possible to run the code without specific installation using colab  

The aim is to

    - give an introduction to concepts and methods important in Usability testing and statistical analysis of data
    - be brief enough to be useful as a first reference point and re-cap to students of media technology

The topic is covered in the following notebooks:
    
    UX 1 When and What of UX?
    UX 2 Collecting data
    UX 3 Descriptive Statistics
    UX 4 Validity and Reliability
    UX 5 Inferential Statistics
    
    
It is my hope that after going through the book and exercises, you should feel confident enough to plan some basic user tests as well as pick up a book on statistics, and work out what type of measurement instruments and analysis that are appropriate to use for a particular evaluation.  

It should be possible to follow and do most of the "think-and-do" try outs without particular skills in python or mathematics.
For those that would like a brief introduction to Python please check out software-carpentry https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and the quick intro to pandas, https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html?highlight=randint.

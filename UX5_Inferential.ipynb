This means that rather than using 1.96 times the standard error, we now change this to 1.645. Similar to adjusting $\\alpha / 2$ in the examples earlier, we adjust to one tail by settling for 90% confidence. This makes sense, because we do not require the limits to be so far away from the main bell as for the 95% confidence so the distance (measured in numbers of standard errors from the mean) is smaller.\n"

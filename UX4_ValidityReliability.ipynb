In the previous chapter, we could se how the *standard error of the mean* decreased with increasing sample sizes. For small samples our estimate of the true population mean is not very accurate. The larger the sample size, the closer we get to the true population mean - but for most practical purposes there it is also ok to not be extremely precise if less can do it. Especially if larger sample sizes are connected to high costs  in resources (which they typically are). \n",

    "We cannot be sure about the exactness of the true value, but we can calculate confidence intervals around it. The confidence interval gives a range within which we, with some confidence, would expect the true value to end up. The width of this interval is dependent on the variation in the population (which we estimate from the sample standard deviation); the size of the sample size (as mentioned above) and also the level of confidence.\n",

    "We cannot control the variability in the population we sample, so if we need to keep the confidence level fixed, the only thing left to affect the width of the confidence interval is the size of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of data (continous, discrete, distribution etc) there are different ways to calculate the confidence intervals. For continuous data we can relate back to the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation for the distribution of sample means. Since this is normally distributed, we know that 95% of values lie within  $\\pm 1.96 \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$  on each side. So a rough estimate of the 95% confidence interval is four times the standard error around the sample mean."

    "\n",
    "We can have highly reliable but invalid results if we, for example, recruit participants that are systematically different from the intended population. This would yield a problem with *external validity*, as the results do not generalize to the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill-planned experiments can also have problem with *internal validity*. One example of this would be if there are unintended systematic differences between experimental and control groups (other than by our manipulation). For instance, data would likely be invalid if we recruit participants to the control group from passers-by in the street, but the experimental group consists of our friends and colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we check for validity? In the case of finding out if someone has musical skill, we can compare their self-report of musical skill with the judgments of experts. For instance, by letting several music teachers independently assess the participant's skill. If their assessments agree with the self-report, there is good support for the validity of our measurement instrument. "

All items are targeting the experienced usability (and learnability) of the system and contribute toward a combined score. Note that the scale is *balanced* in that there are both positively and negatively formulated statements. When scoring, the ratings of negative items needs to be \"flipped\".\n",
